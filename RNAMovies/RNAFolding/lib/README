RNAMovies2 (and beyond) comes with a part of Batik 1.6 (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/) and 
BioDOM 1.2 (http://biodom.sf.net). Both libraries are public available under the conditions of
the Apache License (see LICENSE file in current directory).

If you want have the full possibilities of the Batik and BioDOM libaries we recommend to download
and use the latest and complete packages available at above mentioned webpages. The only reason
for us to give only a part of them to RNAMovies is to decrease the file size for the applet and
(webstart-) application.
